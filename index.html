      <h3>Ways to Sorry – Level Up Your English</h3>
      <h4>
        How many ways to say sorry do you know? I’ve got another question: have
        you ever forgotten your best friend’s birthday, or been late for an
        important meeting? Have you ever been late for an important meeting, or
        spilt coffee on a friend’s shirt? What connects all these situations?
        They’re all situations where you might need to apologise. If so, what
        would you say? Of course, to apologise, you can just say ‘I’m sorry’,
        but there’s much more language that native-level English speakers use to
        apologise and express how they feel. In this lesson, you’ll learn useful
        ways to say sorry in different ways in different situations.

          <h2>Grammar</h2>
          <p>
            English grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into
            wordings in order to structure words, phrases, clauses, sentences,
            and whole texts.
